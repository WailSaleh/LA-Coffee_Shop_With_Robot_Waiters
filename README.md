# LA Coffee Shop With Robot Waiters â˜•ðŸ¤–

Have decided to open a small coffee shop with robot waiters in Los Angeles. It's a very promising project, but expensive, so me and my partners decide to try to attract investors.

They're interested in the current market conditions and want to know if you'll be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters dies down.

I'am an analytics guru, so my partners have asked you to prepare a market survey. We have open-source data about establishments in LA.


**rest_data:**

*object_name: name of establishment*

*chain: network establishment (TRUE/FALSE)*

*object_type: type of establishment*

*address*

*number: number of seats*
